**Q1.java**

 This file has a Java method that takes an integer array as input and outputs the number of inversions
it has. An inversion in an array A is a pair (i, j) of indices such that i < j
and A[i] > A[j].

****Examples****

***input***

10
6 7 3 10 2 9 8 1 5 4

***output***

27
 
***input***

5
1 20 6 4 5

***output***

5

**Q2.java**

  In this file, I implemented 2 pivot variation of the QuickSort algorithm.
  In the variation with 2 pivots, the partitioning process divides the array into three subarrays:
one containing elements less than or equal to the smaller pivot, another containing elements
between the two pivots, and the third containing elements greater than the larger pivot.

**Q23.java**

  In this file, I implemented 3 pivot variation of the QuickSort algorithm.


  **Q2 and Q23 run the same way shown down below. First line you must enter array size second line the array itself.**

  **input**
  
  5
  1.2 4.2 3.3 4.21 3.25
  
  **output**
  
  1.2 3.25 3.3 4.2 4.21
