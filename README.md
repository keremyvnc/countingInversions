**Q1.java**

 This file has a Java method that takes an integer array as input and outputs the number of inversions
it has. An inversion in an array A is a pair (i, j) of indices such that i < j
and A[i] > A[j].

**Q2.java**

  In this file, I implemented 2 pivot variation of the QuickSort algorithm.
  In the variation with 2 pivots, the partitioning process divides the array into three subarrays:
one containing elements less than or equal to the smaller pivot, another containing elements
between the two pivots, and the third containing elements greater than the larger pivot.
